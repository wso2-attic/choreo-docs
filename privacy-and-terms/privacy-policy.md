# Choreo Privacy Policy

Choreo takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains the information we collect when you visit [www.choreo.dev](https://console.choreo.dev/) and how we treat that information. Choreo is owned by WSO2 Inc (“WSO2”) and whenever the terms “we” “us” or “our” appear in this policy, we’re talking about WSO2 and its subsidiary companies.  

When we use the terms “You” and “Your” in this policy, we mean the person or entity visiting our site or using the services on it.

## What information do we collect?

### Information you provide to us
When you sign up for Choreo, use Choreo to create an application, pay for our services, or register for an event, newsletter, or activity on our site, we ask you to provide us all or some of the following information about yourself:

* Your name 
* Email address 
* Telephone number 
* Country 
* State (if applicable) 
* Your payment details (if you are paying for a service) 
* Authentication tokens: If you want to easily integrate Choreo with third party services, you can use authentication tokens instead of storing your credentials. [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is the most commonly used protocol for this purpose. Choreo will request for authentication tokens if and when you try to perform such integrations. 
* API keys and API credentials: Third-party services that do not use the OAuth protocol use either API keys or login credentials. If you want to integrate Choreo with such services, Choreo will ask for the relevant API key to authenticate/authorize communication with the respective third party service's API.

Some of the services on Choreo, such as paid services, may make it mandatory that you provide certain personal details. This is because we require the requested personal details to process and provide the relevant service. However, you have a choice when it comes to providing the requested details. If you choose not to provide your details, you may not be able to have access to those services.

When you build applications using Choreo, the source code of your application will be visible to us. However, you will always own and control your code. Check our terms of use to see how you retain your rights to the code you write. 

### Information we collect automatically
When you visit our site, there is generic information that we can see automatically. This includes your IP address, your browser type, device information, the time and frequency you access our site, and the URL you came from. This type of generic information won’t reveal your identity as a visitor, but is still useful to us to analyze and improve the way our site is being used.

When you use Choreo to create and run applications, we store data such as application logs so that you have the option to view them. We also aggregate non-personally identifiable information about how you use Choreo. This information is important to us to analyze ways in which Choreo is used to develop applications and to understand what our user needs are so that we can make our service better suited to those needs. Such usage data never identifies you personally.
To see how we use cookies, check WSO2’s [cookie policy](https://wso2.com/cookie-policy). 

### Information we get from third parties about you
We may obtain information from other sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services. For example, if you sign in to Choreo through one of our integration partners (i.e., Google or Github), we will have access to basic information such as your name and account details from the sign on service.

When you create an application using Choreo, you may choose to integrate it with various third party services such as messaging services, email, or calendar services. In such scenarios, Choreo’s access to the third party service will be limited to performing the functions that you specify. Choreo does not store any data that resides on these third party services nor does it access such data in any manner without your consent.  Choreo’s use of information received from Google APIs adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the limited use requirements.

## Why do we collect your information?
We use the data we collect to:

* Perform the service you request.  For example, if you request for support, we use your contact details to get in touch with you. If you want to pay for a service, we use your payment details to process the payment. 
* Analyze how Choreo is being used. We rely on analytics based on your activity and applications to improve the Choreo user experience.  For example, we use analytics to make design decisions, find bugs in the system, and recommend actions and features to users.  
* Improve our services and content. We analyze what you have clicked on and what kind of activities or scenarios you run on Choreo so that we can identify common usage scenarios and the manner in which users use Choreo services. We use such statistics to improve our services. 
*  Update you and market our services. If there are updates to your service, important information you need to know, or if we think you would be interested in our technology and what we’re doing with it, we will get in touch with you via your contact details. You have decide to unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by either clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or by contacting us via the Choreo user portal. However, you may still continue to receive any important information about your service, security, or payments.

## Who do we share your information with? 
We don’t sell your information to anyone.

We do share your information within the WSO2 group because our affiliate entities also help provide our services. WSO2 Inc is headquartered in the United States of America. Our current affiliates are WSO2 UK Limited (located in the United Kingdom), WSO2 Lanka (Private) Limited (located in Sri Lanka), WSO2 Brasil Tecnologia E Software Ltda (located in Brazil), WSO2 Germany GmbH (located in Germany) and WSO2 Australia Pty Limited (located in Australia).

Data transfer from the European Union and United Kingdom to other affiliate entities located around the world takes place on the basis of data transfer agreements containing EU standard contractual clauses set out by the European Commission. These clauses guarantee certain levels of physical, administrative, and technical safeguards of your data.

WSO2 has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

We may share data with verified technology partners who provide additional services that enhance our services. Your information may also be visible to our service providers who help us run our platform and provide certain services, such as our customer support platform, marketing, analytics and CRM tools. However, these service providers are only authorized to use information that is strictly relevant for them to perform their tasks. We make sure  that they are under obligations of confidentiality and security to us so that your data is secure. Our hosting provider is Microsoft Azure. For more details on how Microsoft Azure protects your privacy, see [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/).

If you use our paid services, we also use a third party payment card processor. We don’t actually see any of your payment card information. The information goes directly to the payment card processor.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our privacy policy, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.

## How do we process your data?
We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent on one of our forms), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you), and legitimate interests such as to protect you, us, or others from security threats, comply with laws that apply to us, administer our business through consolidated reporting, market our services, etc. 

If you wish to withdraw your consent or object to the processing of your personal data, see the section on [What are your rights to your personal information?](#what-are-your-rights-to-your-personal-information?).

## Is your data secure?
We implement industry standard security safeguards designed to protect your data. We encrypt all data at rest (including credentials/tokens to external systems). All our data transfers are done securely through encrypted channels using transport layer security (TLS) technology. We regularly monitor our systems and conduct tests to identify possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no complete guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or administrative safeguards. 

## What are your rights to your personal information?
We store the information we collect about you for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. For example, we may retain your information throughout the period of time that you have an account to use our website or services. We may also retain your information during the period of time needed for WSO2 to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. At the end of these periods, we ensure that your data is deleted securely using an industry standard methodology.
WSO2 acknowledges your right to access your data. If information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us, then you have the right to access, correct, or edit your data. If you wish, we can provide all the personal information on our records in a portable format either to you or to someone you nominate. 
You can also ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it), or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
You may also choose to delete your data from our website or service at any time and unsubscribe from any Choreo mailing lists you are on. To unsubscribe from our emails, you can click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing email we send. You can click on your account within the Choreo user portal to perform certain functions like deleting your account. You can also reach out to us via <dpo@wso2.com> for assistance on any of the above requests.

We only ever retain your personal data after you have ceased using our services, or sent us a request to unsubscribe or delete your data if it is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or fulfill your request to unsubscribe from further messages from us.

## Third party offerings and services
When you choose to integrate certain functionalities with sites or applications outside of WSO2, you are bound by the terms of the particular site or application.
