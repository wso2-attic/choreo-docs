## 3. Fees and Payment

WSO2 may provide a basic tier that is free of charge. If you wish to use more features or higher capabilities, WSO2 also provides paid subscriptions for the service. Pricing and payment plans for the service are available at http://wso2.com/choreo/pricing. Fees are non-refundable and billed in advance at the frequency set out in your invoice or order. Your subscription period commences on the first day you access the service with a paying account.

If you exceed the subscribed usage plan you will be charged for such excessive usage in accordance with WSO2’s records of your usage data and WSO2 will invoice you accordingly on the next billing cycle. You will not receive prior notification of your excessive usage or of the proportionate increase that will be reflected in your next invoice.

Upgrade of a subscription plan will be made effective immediately, but cancellations and downgrades will be made effective from the next billing cycle; accordingly no refunds will be offered.

You will be issued with receipts for payments made.

All fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any taxes arising from or relating to these terms, including without limitation, sales, service, use or value added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. **taxes** means any form of taxation, levy, duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If you are required under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had you made no withholdings or deductions.

WSO2 reserves the right to change list prices and pricing plans in line with periodic scheduled price revisions. If WSO2 is of the view that such a change may adversely affect the plan you have subscribed to, you will receive thirty (30) days prior notice by email of the proposed change.

## 5. Termination of Services

If you are using a paid subscription, your subscription shall be automatically renewed for another twelve month term unless you have notified WSO2 thirty (30) days prior to the end of the term of your intention to terminate. Fees at the time of automatic renewal will be at the rates current at the time of such renewal.

Upon termination of the services due to a breach or default on your part, WSO2 will have no obligation to refund to you any fees paid by you. 
 
You may discontinue your use of the service at any time. Termination will not relieve you from the obligation to pay fees unpaid.

WSO2 reserves the right to terminate any account at any time at its sole discretion.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

You expressly acknowledge and agree that:

1. your use of the service is at your sole risk and the services are provided on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis, to the maximum extent permissible by law. WSO2 expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement with respect to the services, products, software or other material available through the WSO2 sites;

2. that WSO2 does not warrant that the services will meet your requirements, will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free or reliable;

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither WSO2 nor its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and agents will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of the use of (or inability to use) the service in whole or part, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use or loss of data or other intangible losses. To the maximum extent permitted by law, WSO2 its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and agents will not be liable for any damages that exceed the total amounts paid by you to WSO2 for the services during the twelve month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to such claim. If you are using a free version of the service, WSO2’s liability to you is limited to $10. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, WSO2’s liability and that of its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, and agents will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## 9. Release

If you have a dispute with one or more users, you hereby release WSO2, its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, agents, officers and employees from claims, demands and damages (direct and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident or an entity incorporated in California, you waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 which says A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in such creditor’s favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by the creditor must have materially affected such creditor’s settlement with the debtor

## 10. Arbitration

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these terms will be finally settled by arbitration, except that WSO2 may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute affecting WSO2’s intellectual property rights whether statutory or contractual. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (Rules). Any such controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in San Jose, California United States, and the judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English by a single arbitrator selected under the rules, who must be a lawyer and fluent in English. The arbitrator has no authority to award damages in excess of those permitted in these terms for any reason. Any award in excess of such limitation will be deemed void as between the parties. Either you or WSO2 may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in San Jose, California, necessary to protect the rights or the property of you or WSO2, its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, and agents, pending the completion of arbitration.

8.
